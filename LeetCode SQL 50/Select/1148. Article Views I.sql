There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Input: 
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

with v as(

/**
Approach Used: with the v cte --> we count each author has watched how many unique " count(distinct article_id) " articles that they have written (where author_id = viewer_id )

So for the given input table :
Input: 
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Result is :

author_id | c
   4      | 1  (article id 3)
   7      | 1  (article id 2)

after which i have written " select * from v " command --> where i fetch only those rows where author has watched more than 1 of its articles 
(This could have been skipped..but ihvae written just in case the condition was >=2 or etc.)
